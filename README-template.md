## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma Dev Mode

### What I learned

Starting to get comfortable with Flexbox now. I have learned not to take **all** the CSS from Figma Dev Mode as is, as that can cause some issues - it's better just to grab what's necessary such as spacing, sizes and colours.

### Continued development

At this point I'm 100% focused on development, so will continue to stick to the provided designs, at least for now.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox) - This excellent guide to Flexbox from the excellent web.dev project is very well written.
- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I think this it *the* standard for Flexbox. I particularly like the way it splits out the properties for the parent container and child items.
